# Selenium Page Object Model Demo
This repository contains a sample application that demonstrates the implementation of the Page Object Model (POM) using Selenium WebDriver. 
The application is designed to simulate the Amazon web page and includes various objects such as item, search bar, home page, and result page.
## Introduction
The Page Object Model (POM) is a design pattern commonly used in Selenium test automation to improve the maintainability and readability of tests. 
It involves creating separate classes for each page of the application, encapsulating the page elements and related actions within those classes. This approach promotes code reusability and makes tests easier to maintain.
